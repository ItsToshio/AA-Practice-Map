Getting An Upgrade:
Practice simply speedcrafting a stone pick, crafting the stone pick after resummoning the dragon in the end, or crafting the pick from scratch across twelve different biomes and scenarios, just like in a real run!

Seedy Place:
Practice using a hoe and planting a seed as quickly as possible or in the end after resummoning the dragon, just remember to place a torch!

Fishy Business:
Practice fishing the old fashioned way, hypermodern fishy business, and hypermodern fishy business in the end after resummoning the dragon!
